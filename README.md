## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

## Usage

This boilerplate can be used for creating a repository that uses GitHub Actions for scheulding and running tasks.
To get started using this boilerplate, follow along with the steps below:

**Three steps**

1. [download](#download)
2. [customize](#customize)
3. [configure](#configure)

Let's walk through each step.

### Download

Download this boilerplate with the following command:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/transparent/actions-template.git
```

### Customize

Next, update the [default task](./lib/tasks/default.js) or add new tasks to the [tasks]('./lib/tasks') folder:

**my-task.js**

```js
'use strict'

module.exports = async options => {
  console.log('This task is run with the command line arguments passed in as an `options` object.');
  console.log(options);
};
```

**Notes**

* Update the [tasks index](./lib/tasks/index.js) file to include your new task:
  ```js
  module.exports = {
    'my-task': require('./my-task');
  };
  ```

### Configure

A default [workflow file]('./github/workflows/main.yml') is included that will run the `default` task daily at 8AM UTC.
You can modify this file to change the time or specify another task or options to run.
You can also create new workflow files to run more tasks or schedule tasks to run at different times.
